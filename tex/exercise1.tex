\section{Exercise 1 - Mid-depth temperature and \delO{SW} reconstruction}

\subsection{Question 1}
\label{sec:Q1}
According to \citeauthor{barker2003study} \parencite{barker2003study}, foraminiferal Fe/Mg molar ratios greater than approximately 0.1 are indicative of potential contamination by Mg-rich clay silicates.
Mg/Ca measurements could therefore be rejected if they do not meet the criteria:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fe_mg}
    \frac{\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{Ca}}{\mathrm{Mg}/\mathrm{Ca}} < 0.1 \, \mathrm{mol \cdot mol^{-1}}
\end{equation}

However, visual assessment of the magnitude of potential contamination (Figure \ref{fig:Mg_Fe}) shows that all but one of the eight measurements failing the this criteria are close to the rest of the data in terms of Fe/Mg.
As a result, only the 16.39 ka measurement labelled in Figure \ref{fig:Mg_Fe} is rejected for contamination.

\subsection{Question 2}
As shown in Figure \ref{eq:timeseries}, the mid-depth seawater oxygen isotope excursion \delO{SW} declines to negative values after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in correspondance with falling water temperatures.
The two trends fall sharply toward the beginning of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) before diverging: in contrast to the gradual temperature recovery from nearly 0 \degree{}C, \delO{SW} continues to strongly decrease until the transition into the Bølling–Allerød warm period (BA, 14.7–12.9 ka \parencite{thornalley2011reconstructing}), at which point both lines rise together rapidly.
The Younger Dryas (YD) marks a very abrupt return to HS1 temperatures, although the concurrent drop in \delO{SW} is not as severe, whereas each record shows relative stability over the course of the Holocene.

The imprint of local salinity on foramineferal Mg/Ca may result in significant systematic positive bias in reconstructed \delO{SW} \parencite{mathien2009salinity}, whereas uncertainties in foramineferal \delO{carbonate} stemming from nonclimatic factors, such as measurement imprecision or variations in seawater carbonate ion concentration, are comparatively small \parencite{bell2014local}. 
Assuming these issues are negligeable, the control of water oxygen isotopic composition hydrological fractionation processes at the surface make it useful as a salinity proxy, allowing an interior ocean water mass's surface origin to be inferred \parencite{ravelo2007use, lynch2014tracers}.
Although sea ice formation is the primary control on intermediate water salinity, given the subpolar location of the RAPiD-10-1P core, the relatively small isotopic effect of brine rejection means that the surface water source \delO{SW} signal is largely conserved \parenicte{thornalley2010intermediate}. 
In accordance with previous studies \parencite{thornalley2010intermediate, thornalley2011reconstructing}, the drop in \delO{SW} over HS1 could therefore be interpreted to reflect the displacement of cold, hypersaline, 18O-enriched high-latitude deep water by an increasing sink of isotopically lighter surface waters of primarily glacial origin by enhancement of local brine formation.
% Futhermore, the abrupt drops in \delO{SW} and temperature preceeding HS1 indicate the sudden influx of glacial meltwater. 
These results support the theorised stratification, \ldots

% Thorn says it shows GNAIW
